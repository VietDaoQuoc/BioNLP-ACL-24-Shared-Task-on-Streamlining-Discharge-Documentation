# BioNLP ACL'24 Shared Task on Streamlining Discharge Documentation
- This is an university project that Viet Dao Quoc and Xuanzhi Chen did
- We deployed a RAG-model and used it together with different generative LLM-models for few-shot prompting for INFERENCE on the data.
- The goal is to generate these two critical sections of Discharge Instructions and Brief Hospital Course of discharge summaries.
- Since we only had 2 months for doing this project we could only did the INFERENCE without FINE-TUNNING. 
- For more details, please take a look into our final report.
